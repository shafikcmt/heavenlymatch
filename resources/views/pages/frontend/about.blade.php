      <p>Indeed, all praise belongs to Allah. We seek refuge in Him from the evils within ourselves and from our ill deeds. Peace and blessings be upon the Prophet (ﷺ).</p>

      <p>Marriage is a distinctive blessing given by Almighty Allah and a vital Sunnah of the Prophet (ﷺ). According to the Qur'an and Hadith, wedding is regarded as a means of purity, half of the deen (religion) and a means of financial prosperity. Allah commands the believers to marry for its benefits morally, spiritually, socially and psychologically.</p>

      <p>The purpose of marriage is to provide a legal union which safeguards society from moral and social degradation. On the other hand, it is a matter of great regret that people being influenced by Western civilization are chasing the sick race of so-called equality between men and women that goes against the commandment of Allah and consequently, moral degradation is taking place in the society. Indeed, the main reason for the infiltration of the uncivilized culture of the West in education, work, and marriage is not to follow the rules based on Islamic Shariah and the lack of complete religious education. As a result, marriage has become challenging and society is being burdened constantly with various degradations including adultery, fornication, extramarital affairs, rape, suicide, etc.</p>

      <p>Moreover, those who are struggling against the un-Islamic culture of the family and the so-called social norms to cling to the Sunnah in this age of dreadful fitna (a state of trouble or chaos) are facing many complications to find pious life partners. Pondering over the issues we, some sinful slaves of Allah became optimistic to solve these problems and finally succeeded in establishing a Bangladeshi Islamic matrimonial platform, <b>HeavenlyMatch.com</b> and on January 1, 2021, we launched its journey effectively. By the mercy and special blessings of Allah, hundreds of practicing Muslims have already been married through the website, Alhamdulillah.</p>

      <p>Our aim is to make this website a Shariah-based Islamic matrimony platform and to make it easy to find religious matchmakers. Our prime motto of the Site is to popularize the Sunnah way of Islamic marriage by wiping out all superstitions and barbarism of the present jahiliyyah (days of ignorance) society and making everyone aware of dowry (an eternal curse for the bride's family) and encouraging the matchmaking with mahr (valuable gift by grooms).</p>

      <p>To conclude, we have far-reaching plans for the development of our website and we are constantly researching to make the site easier for the users. We are trying our best to deliver this service efficiently to all Muslim brothers and sisters as soon as possible. May Allah keep our intentions pure, make all our good deeds easy and grant us blessings. Ameen.</p>
